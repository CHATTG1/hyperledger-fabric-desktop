#### Development Guides

We will take the development of channel management as an example to introduce how to develop a new function.
If you are willing to have the new function with a single user interface, the development process can refer to the 
following steps:
1. Write a new user interface, name it `ChannelManageContent.jsx`.
2. Write a new function interface, name it `ChannelManage` function.
3. Create a new database if data persistence needed.
4. Check the code specification before submitting.

##### Write a new user interface

Access to  directory `src/components/content`,you can add a new file `ChannelManageContent.jsx`.After successfully 
added, you need to add a new content route in `src/components/BasicLayout.jsx` as an entrance.

We are using React to build user interfaces, and it's highly recommended to write the React component with ES6:
```react
import React,{ Component } from 'react';

class MyComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>a new component</div>
    );
  }
}

```
If there are multiple components and tightly coupled, you can ignore the constraint that there is only one component 
in one `.jsx` file  by Eslint and declare multiple components in one `.jsx` file.

##### Write a new function interface

Of courseï¼Œyou can create a new file, such as `channel.js`, to develop the `ChannelManage` function interface.
But it's recommended to declare a `ChannelManage` function in existed `fabric.js`file.

##### Create a new database 

Create a new database if data persistence needed. You can add a persistent datastore with automatic loading using
```javascript
var Datastore = require('nedb')
  , db = new Datastore({ filename: 'path/to/datafile', autoload: true });
```
or more complicated but widely used, you can add by 
```javascript
let chaincodeDB;
export function getChaincodeDBSingleton() {
  if (!chaincodeDB) {
    chaincodeDB = new Datastore({ filename: path.join(__dirname, '../../resources/persistence/chaincode.db'), autoload: true });
  }
  return chaincodeDB;
}
```
in `src/util/createDB.js`.

##### Check the code specification

Check the code specification before submitting.You can execute the following command to check the code:
```bash
npm run lint
```
and fix it by
```bash
npm run lintFix
```

When there are some problems that cannot be fixed automatically, you need to manually repair according to the IDE's prompts.

> Note! <br/>
> You need to set the IDE's code quality tool to Eslint when using IDE's automatically prompt.

#### Code specification

For code specification, we took ESlint and tried to fully satisfy the ESlint constraint.But in some special cases, 
we have relaxed the ESlint constraint appropriately. Currently, We relaxed the ESLint constraint in two places:
1. We use underline `_` to distinguish function private or public.  
2. If there are multiple components and tightly coupled, you can ignore the constraint that there is only one component 
   in one `.jsx` file by Eslint and declare multiple components in one `.jsx` file.

If you encounter an ESlint constraint that needs to be properly relaxed during the development process, truly that 
the ESlint specification is not properly constrained, you can open a relevant issue on [github](https://github.com/blockchain-desktop/hyperledger-fabric-desktop).
This ESlint constraint will be released after the fact is ascertained.

#### Development Route

* v0.1.0 : basic function (Block Dashboard, Chaincode Install, Chaincode Invoke).
* v0.2.0 : Add channel management function and other features
* v0.3.0~: Add features and improve infrastructure

Hyperledgr fabric desktop is currently in the v0.1.0 version phase
